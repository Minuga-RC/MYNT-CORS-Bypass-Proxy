# Host Your Own MYNT CORS Bypass Proxy
Clone this repo in your VPS and run `npm i` & `npm run start`
that will start up your proxy server in port `3000`
so ur proxy URL would be `http://<your-server-ip>:3000`

- To change the port create a `.env` file and add the value `PORT=<port_number>`
- Using pm2 to run the proxy server is recommended
